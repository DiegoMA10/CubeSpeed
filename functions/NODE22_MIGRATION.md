# Migration to Node.js 22

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the Firebase Functions from Node.js 18 to Node.js 22.

## Changes Made

1. Updated the Node.js version in `package.json`:
   ```
   "engines": {
     "node": "22"
   }
   ```

2. Updated the runtime in `firebase.json`:
   ```
   "runtime": "nodejs22"
   ```

3. Updated the README.md to reflect the Node.js 22 migration.

## Testing Instructions

After applying these changes, you should test the functions to ensure they work correctly with Node.js 22:

1. Deploy the functions to Firebase:
   ```
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

2. Monitor the Firebase Functions logs for any errors:
   ```
   firebase functions:log
   ```

3. Test each function to ensure it works as expected:
   - Test the HTTP function by making a request to the endpoint
   - Test the Firestore triggers by creating, updating, and deleting documents

## Compatibility Notes

The code in `index.js` has been reviewed and appears to be fully compatible with Node.js 22. The code uses modern JavaScript features that are well-supported in Node.js 22.

## Rollback Plan

If any issues are encountered with Node.js 22, you can roll back to Node.js 18 by:

1. Reverting the changes in `package.json`:
   ```
   "engines": {
     "node": "18"
   }
   ```

2. Reverting the changes in `firebase.json`:
   ```
   "runtime": "nodejs18"
   ```

3. Redeploying the functions:
   ```
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```
